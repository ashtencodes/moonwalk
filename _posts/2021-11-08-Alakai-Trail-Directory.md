A web application that allows state officials and the general public to monitor the foot-traffic density on any of Hawaii's hiking trails. This was our team's entry to the [Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge](https://hacc.hawaii.gov) (HACC) 2021, which got us invited to the finals day present to judges and an audience.

# Overview
Trails are overburdened by congestion, and hikers are often unaware of proper trail etiquette and information. This poses a risk to the wellbeing of trail ecosystems, and a safety risk to hikers themselves. Alaka’i offers a variety of features to provide hikers with reliable and accurate information, along with the ability to reverse trail damage through donations.

# Trail Catalog
Our catalog offers a one-stop-shop for all the information any hiker may need. Trails are displayed on cards for users to search through. Clicking on the card reveals more useful details.

# Traffic Information
Real time traffic data is available to users through colored paths. Encouraging hikers to plan based on the traffic indicators reduces the burden on trail ecosystems and local communities.
Our website provides access to past and future predictive data generated by the reservations feature.

# Reservations
Our reservation feature provides a solution to overburdened trails by aligning the interests of hikers and the state
Nobody enjoys hiking on busy trails. When reservations are made, our color indicators update and hikers are made aware of when other users plan to hike. Naturally, hikers will make reservations at less busy times reducing traffic without strict state enforcement.
