# Robotic Space Exploration Lab
The Robotic Space Exploration Lab (RoSE) is an undergraduate and graduate student led research lab at the University of Hawaii studying space exploration and research applications in robotics! Our projects range from studying rover terramechanics to machine learning powered celestial navigation and satellite development.

As a Software Engineer and Integrator for the Autonomous Mars Rover vertically integrated project (VIP), I design, develop, test, and deploy a navigation stack providing our rover with autonomous navigation capabilities. Many subsystems consisting of over 30 students contribute to a single rover designed to compete at the [University Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/home), a international collegiate robotics competition.

Clicking on a trail's card reveals details about the hike like the route description, difficluty, total distance, and average time it takes someone to complete the hike.

# Challenges And Accomplishments
The biggest challenge our team encountered was the management of large datasets across multiple local development platforms. Passing the necessary data to every corner of the project was difficult and clunky at first, but through a large-scale overhaul of our database and restructuring to use AJAX requests, we were able to clean up our code and easily access our database information. Another large accomplishment for the team was the sudden delve into web development. A majority of our team has little to no prior experience with web development, yet we were able to use this competition as an opportunity to jump in head first into new territory, which significantly accelerated our growth as programmers. We were able to learn more about web design, proper coding practices, and maximizing the use of version control systems.
