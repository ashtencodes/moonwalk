A web application that allows state officials and the general public to monitor the foot-traffic density on any of Hawaii's hiking trails. This was our team's entry to the [Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge](https://hacc.hawaii.gov) (HACC) 2021. Selected as finalists, our team presented to Hawaii government officials and judges from companies like Microsoft and Amazon.

# Challenges And Accomplishments
The biggest challenge our team encountered was the management of large datasets across multiple local development platforms. Passing the necessary data to every corner of the project was difficult and clunky at first, but through a large-scale overhaul of our database and restructuring to use AJAX requests, we were able to clean up our code and easily access our database information. Another large accomplishment for the team was the sudden delve into web development. A majority of our team has little to no prior experience with web development, yet we were able to use this competition as an opportunity to jump in head first into new territory, which significantly accelerated our growth as programmers. We were able to learn more about web design, proper coding practices, and maximizing the use of version control systems.
