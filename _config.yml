  Hello! I am a second-year computer engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
  
  I develop autonomous robotic systems for space exploration applications. I currently lead research centering around cooperative robotics and multi-agent systems for planetary exploration and mobility. In the future, I hope to explore opportunities in autonomous robotics for global sustainability and clean energy.
  
  With strong backgrounds in software engineering, project management, and entrepreneurship, my larger goals are to bring people and ideas together to develop technologies that help to create a happier and more sustainable world.
